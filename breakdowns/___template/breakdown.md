# Work description

## Interactive Media Installation

A large-scale interactive environment that responds to visitor presence and movement through synchronized audiovisual
elements. The installation creates an immersive experience by combining motion tracking, real-time graphics, and spatial
audio.

## Technical Components

### Input Systems

- Motion tracking cameras (2-3 units)
- Depth sensors for precise positioning
- Optional touchscreen interface
- Environmental sensors (temperature, light)

### Output Systems

- High-power projectors (6000+ lumens)
- [Multi-channel speaker array](tool:MultiChannelSpeakerArray)
- LED accent lighting
- Control interface displays

### Processing

- Main control computer with GPU
- Real-time graphics engine
- [Audio synthesis](technique:AudioSynthesis) server
- Network hub for component synchronization

## Implementation Requirements

### Software Dependencies

- Custom tracking application
- Graphics rendering pipeline
- [Audio](tag:audio) generation system
- System monitoring tools

### Physical Setup

- Minimum room size: 8x8x4 meters
- Dedicated power circuits
- Network infrastructure
- Light-controlled environment

### Interaction Design

1. Entry detection and participant tracking
2. Movement analysis and gesture recognition
3. Real-time visual feedback generation
4. Spatial audio synthesis
5. Multi-user interaction handling

## Maintenance Procedures

- Daily system checks
- Weekly calibration
- Monthly hardware inspection
- Quarterly software updates
